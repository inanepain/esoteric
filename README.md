## What Is Numerology And What Are The Different Indicators?

Numerology is an age-old science that focuses on finding the essence of every personality. It is said to indicate the purpose of your life and the challenges, obstacles, and opportunities you might face. Like astrology, it claims to give you a hint on what can help and what cannot in your life.

Each person is associated with multiple numbers in numerology that are calculated in different ways. Each number indicates a certain phase of your personality or future.

The different indicators in numerology are:

1. **Life path number**: This is the most critical number in your numerology chart and is calculated using your birth date. It reveals your strengths, weaknesses, challenges, lessons, and events you are likely to face in your lifetime. This number can help you see the path more clearly and spot the opportunities.
2. **Destiny number**: This number is calculated using your first name and surname. It is also known as expression, name or namank number. It gives you a glance of your purpose in life. It describes your character, unveils your goals and gives you an idea on how to achieve them, and also lets you know the obstacles that can come your way.
3. **Personality number**: This number is calculated using the consonants in your first name. It is also known as the dream or inner-dream number. The number describes your personality and gives you an idea of how others see you. Knowing how others perceive you will help you overcome fallacious perceptions and let your inner soul shine through.
4. **Soul number**: This number is calculated using the numbers corresponding the vowels in your first name and surname. It is also known as soul urge number or heart desire number. It gives you an insight of your inner strengths, likes, dislikes, and resources. Simply put, it says who you are and reveals the inner self that you may have kept hidden from others.
